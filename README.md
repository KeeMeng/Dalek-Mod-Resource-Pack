# Dalek-Mod-Resource-Pack

## Improving some textures for The Dalek Mod

CTM (Connected Textures Mod) is required for this resource pack, to add the connected textures as well as glowing ores/roundels. If you don,t some textures will be really strange

Install resource pack: Drag and drop the entire "Dalek Mod +" folder into your `/minecraft/resourcepacks` folder, and choose Dalek Mod + as your resource pack. You can also select which textures you don't want by deleting it from the folder. 

Install CTM: Download the 1.12.2 version of CTM from https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ctm/files and drag it into `/minecraft/mods` folder, and relaunch minecraft.
